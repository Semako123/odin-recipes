        <h3>Steps in preparing Pickled squash</h3>
        <p>These are the ingredients and procedures involved in making pickled squash</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup salt </li>
            <li>2 small onions, thinly sliced </li>
            <li>2¼ cups white sugar </li>
            <li>2 cups distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons mustard seed </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>  
            <li>1 teaspoon celery seed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large non-aluminum pot, combine the squash, bell pepper, and onions. Cover with salt, and let stand for 2 hours to release the liquids. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Just before the 2 hours are up, combine the sugar, vinegar, mustard seed, turmeric and celery seed in a saucepan. Bring to a boil. Drain the salty liquid from the vegetables. Pour the spice brine over the vegetables, and let stand for 2 more hours.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil once again, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Ladle into 1 pint sterile jars, filling with the liquid to within 1/4 inch of the top. Wipe rims with a clean towel, and run a thin spatula around the inside of the jar to remove air bubbles. Seal with lids and rings. Process for 10 minutes in a simmering water bath to seal completely.</li>
        </ol>
